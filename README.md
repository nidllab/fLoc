# FLoc Task Protocol

Version: $Id:$ $Format:%cd by %aN$


# Important Notes

- Opens in MATLAB
- 2 Experimental Sessions (each session/run is approx 4 mins)
- try NOT to use emergency quit (because data is not saved unless the whole experiment is finished)

## Emergency quit:

- in case of emergency, quit experiment by typing @ (does not save)
- if the screen is frozen, type `sca` and then the `return` key
- If that does not work, press `ctrl-c`. Then `alt+tab` and close the psychtoolbox window

# Protocol

## Instructions for Participants:

> For this experiment, you will see many pictures. Whenever you see a picture that appears twice, I want you to press the button as fast as you can. 

> There are not many pictures that will repeated, so pay very close attention not to miss any!

> Do you have any questions? 

> We will be doing this experiment twice, each time will only be about 4 minutes long.

> Let's get started on the first task!

## To Run:

1. Open MATLAB
1. Type `famfloc` at the Matlab command window
2. When prompted, enter subject ID
3. When prompted, enter the run number (1 or 2)
5. When you see the text 'Press a button when an image repeats on sequential trials', start the MRI

## Between Runs:

1. Talk to the participant to make sure they are still doing fine, and give them a short break
2. Ask the participant if they are ready for the next run, which will be another 4 minutes
3. In the MatLab Command Window, type `y` when asked if you want to proceed to run 2
