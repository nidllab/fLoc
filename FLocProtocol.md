# FLoc Task Protocol

### Important Notes

- Opens in MATLAB
- 2 Experimental Sessions (each session/run is approx 4 mins)
- try NOT to use emergency quit (because data is not saved unless the whole experiment is finished)

#### Emergency quit:

- in case of emergency, quit experiment by pressing "q" on your keyboard
- if the screen is frozen, type "S" "C" "A" and then the "return" key 

### Experiment

#### Instructions for Participants:

> For this experiment, you will see many pictures. Whenever you see a picture that appears twice, I want you to press the button as fast as you can. 

> There are not many pictures that will repeated, so pay very close attention not to miss any!

> Do you have any questions? 

> We will be doing this experiment twice, each time will only be about 4 minutes long.

> Let's get started on the first task!

#### To Run:

File: Documents/Experiments/FamilyStudy/ __runme_fLoc.m__

1. Click green arrow icon at the top panel to RUN the experiment
2. When prompted, enter participant's ID
3. Once the task instruction screen appears, the experiment will start automatically after receiving MRI trigger

#### Between Runs:

1. When Run#1 is over, the experiment will prompt you to press any key to stop the run
2. Talk to the participant to make sure they are still doing fine, and give them a short break
3. Ask the participant if they are ready for the next run, which will be another 4 minutes
4. In the MatLab Command Window, type "y" when asked if you want to proceed to run 2
